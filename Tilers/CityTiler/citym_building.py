Notes on the 3DCityDB database structure

The data is organised in the following way in the database:

- the building table contains the "abstract" building
subdivisions (building, building part)
- the thematic_surface table contains all the surface objects (wall,
roof, floor), with links to the building object it belongs to
and the geometric data in the surface_geometry table

- the cityobject table contains information about all the objects
- the surface_geometry table contains the geometry of all objects
